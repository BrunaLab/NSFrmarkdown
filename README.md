# NSFrmarkdown
An R Markdown template for NSF proposals

This template makes use of R Markdown website features to render all .Rmd files at once.

## Steps

Edit the .Rmd files for each of the sections of the grant. If you knit the document, a .pdf will be compiled into the doc folder.

You can compile all of the .Rmd files at once by using the build tab, and clicking build website.

## Tweaking the style

The style folder contains `nsf2.cls` and  `preamble.tex`. Both of which can be edited to change aspects of the style.

## Embedding R graphs

The `Project_Descrtion.Rmd` contains one example of embedding an R figure, and wrapping text around the figure.
